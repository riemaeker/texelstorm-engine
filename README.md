# ðŸŒ‹ Texelstorm engine

Toy game engine written as an exercise in modern C++ and 3D graphics programming.

## Getting Started

Building Texelstorm requires the SDL 2 development libraries; running it requires the SDL 2 runtime. Both can be found on the [SDL website](https://www.libsdl.org/).

The program should build using any standard C++17 toolchain , i.e. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/). If you're looking for a good IDE, try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).
